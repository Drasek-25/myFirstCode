This was the first code I ever wrote. I decided to screw around with some coding on a whim and started watching videos on python. I asked a friend to give me a challange and she posed this problem to me.

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

I decided to go the extra step and make it so 3, 5, and 1000 were user chosen variables.
